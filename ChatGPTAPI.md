# Analysis of about the ChatGPT API wrt. our needs

At least initially we will restrict ourselves to the [ChatGPT chat API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat) 
with gpt-3.5-turbo , since that model is likely appropriate and sufficient for our purposes, and rather 
[competitively priced](https://openai.com/pricing) at
$0.002 / 1K tokens (= about 600-700 words), as of 4/2023.
