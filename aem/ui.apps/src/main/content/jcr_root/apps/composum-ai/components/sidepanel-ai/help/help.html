<h2>Usage of the side panel AI</h2>
<p>The Composum side panel AI is tailored to give you feedback and suggestions about the content you have created. It
    can
    check grammar and style, provide various suggestions or answer questions about the content. Please have a look at
    the preselected prompts you can use, but please do let yourself be inspired to extend them or experiment what other
    things the AI can help you with.<br></p>
<p>With the base text selector you can choose whether you want to provide
    the AI with the textual content on the page, with the textual content of the currently selected component or with no
    additional content at all, in case you want to discuss things independent of the page you edit. The AI can serve you
    with all its extensive knowledge.<br><br>If you want to ask additional questions about the output of the AI, you can
    continue below in a chat. But often it is also reasonable to edit your prompt until you are satisfied with the
    result. Especially when changing the topic it's likely better to start fresh. For each page where you use the
    side panel AI maintains a history of your session for each page, which you can navigate using the back and forward
    buttons. You can therefore easily revisit previous prompts and responses.<br><br>There is a submit button and a stop
    button to trigger the AI reply, but you can also just press enter.<br><br></p>
<p>It's important to note that the
    AI's responses are not deterministic. This means you can request the same task multiple times and receive slightly
    different responses. This can be particularly useful when you're looking for multiple suggestions or perspectives,
    and in case of random lapses. But if you are not satisfied with the response, it is often a good idea to add
    information about what you want different to the prompt, like you would talk to another person.<br><br>If you don't
    know them already - there are a translation assistant and a content creation assistant and a page category
    suggestion assistant available - check for the icons in the field labels in the component dialogs.</p>

<h2>Caution</h2>
<p>
    As with all artificial intelligence based services, please be aware that AIs currently sometimes create content that
    is wrong though it might even look right on the first glance. Please do never use AI generated content without
    manually checking it.</p>
