### Configuration

Using the Composum AI needs an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) that can either be configured for
the whole server in the OSGI configuration "Composum AI GPT Chat Completion Service" or flexibly per site or
content-tree with Sling Context Aware Configuration in the "Composum AI OpenAI Configuration".

It is also possible to restrict Composum AI via OSGI or context aware configuration to certain users / groups,
components, paths, page templates and views (configuration "Composum AI Permission Configuration").
