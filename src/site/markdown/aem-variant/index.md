# Composum AI for Adobe AEM as a Cloud Service

[Our blog](https://www.composum.com/home/blog/AEM/composumAI-AEM.html) gives a nice overview over the functionality.
The [installation instructions](installation.md) tell you how to try it out and / or install it in your server. The
Sling package is available freely over the public maven repository.
