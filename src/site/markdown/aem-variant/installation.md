# Installation of the Composum AI within Adobe AEM as a Cloud Service

BTW: If you'd like to give it a quick try without installing it, you might also try the
[Composum Pages variant](../composum-variant/) on our [Composum Cloud](https://cloud.composum.com),
which is freely available for testing purposes. The functionality of the Sidebar AI and the Content Creation Dialog
work very similar to the AEM pendants, though the general usage of Composum Pages is different than AEM, of course.

## Availability as a Sling Package

For AEM, there is a
[package on maven central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.composum.ai.aem/composum-ai.all) to deploy. You
will need to configure an OpenAI API key as well.

The release notes are available
[on Github](https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-AI/releases).
