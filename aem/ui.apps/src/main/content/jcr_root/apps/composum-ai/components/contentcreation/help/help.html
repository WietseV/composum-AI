<h2>Usage of the content creation dialog</h2>
<p>The Content Creation Assistant can support you when creating or revising texts by creating new texts according to
    your prompt, summarize content, make suggestions for introductions, conclusions, headlines, write a text based on
    your notes, answer questions based on the page, improve existing content, you name it. What is generated depends on
    the instructions you give in the prompt.</p>
<p>To get started using the Content Creation Assistant, open the dialog from any text field or area in the
    component dialog, or from toolbar of the the richtext editor. From there, you can enter a custom prompt or select
    from a range of predefined prompts to guide
    the Content Creation Assistant's output. The predefined prompts can be seen as examples - you are welcome to modify
    them as you see fit.</p>
<p>If you like, you can select a desired text length such as &quot;one line,&quot; &quot;one sentence,&quot; &quot;one
    paragraph,&quot; or &quot;several paragraphs&quot;. Such instructions can also be given in the prompt itself.</p>
<p>For tasks like summarizing etc. you can select a source text to give to the AI as the basis of executing your prompt.
    You can select the textual content of the current page, the current component, or the current output in the content
    suggestion field for iterative improvements. A source text can also be copied into the "Source Content" field.</p>
<p>When you're ready to generate your content, simply press the &quot;Generate&quot; button or press Enter in the input
    prompt area and the Content Creation
    Assistant will create a content suggestion based on your prompt and selected additional input. You can then review
    or edit the generated content in the &quot;content suggestion&quot; field. If you're happy with the generated
    content, press &quot;Replace&quot; to replace the existing content in the component property you were editing with
    the generated content or &quot;Append&quot; to add the generated content to the end of the existing content. The
    generated content is not yet saved to the page, just put into the content suggestion field of the component
    dialog.</p>
<p>If you like to try several times: the dialog keeps a history of the settings and the result: you can browse that
    history with the back and forward buttons. The text generation is non-deterministic - you can retry with the same
    settings and will usually get a different suggestion, but you can also modify your prompt and try again.
    When you're done press "Done", and the content suggestion will be copied into the editor from which you called the
    dialog.</p>
