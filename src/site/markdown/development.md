## More project documentation

## In project documentation

The [project sources](https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-AI) contain much development documentation in various
documentation files. In particular:

- [featurespecs/](https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-AI/tree/develop/featurespecs) contains documentations for
  the various features.
- [Architecture](https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-AI/blob/develop/Architecture.md) contains a description of the
  chosen project architecture and records
  architectural decisions.
- [Project structure](https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-AI/blob/develop/ProjectStructure.md) describes the module
  structure of the project.
- [ChatGPT API Analysis](https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-AI/blob/develop/ChatGPTAPI.md) contains a discussion of
  the ChatGPT API wrt. our project.
- [Next steps](https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-AI/blob/develop/NextSteps.md) contains a sketch of the next steps
  to be taken.

The [Composum AI issues](https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-AI/issues) contains more concrete plans for
enhancing it, and is a place where you are welcome to place suggestions and bug reports!

## Development with ChatGPT and Github Copilot

Part of the intention of the project is to evaluate the use of AI services, in particular ChatGPT and the Github
Copilot IntelliJ plugin, for speeding up development. Some outcomes of that:

- The [feature creation process](https://github.
  com/ist-dresden/composum-AI/tree/develop/featurespecs/FeatureCreationProcess.md)
  massively improves the quality and speed of
  specifying a feature and thinking it through. See the
  [feature specification directory](https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-AI/tree/develop/featurespecs/) for
  examples of that.
- Speeding up the development is ongoing, but Github Copilot and ChatGPT certainly
  [speed up a lot of things](http://www.stoerr.net/blog/2023-05-25-developmentWithChatGPTAndCopilot.html).
